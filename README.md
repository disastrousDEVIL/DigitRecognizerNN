## Project Overview
**DigitRecognizerNN** is a machine learning project focused on recognizing handwritten digits using a neural network. This project utilizes the famous MNIST dataset, which consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The objective is to accurately classify each digit image into the correct category.

## Features
1) __Data Loading__: Efficiently loading the MNIST dataset using libraries such as pandas and numpy.
2) __Data Preprocessing__: Normalizing and reshaping data to prepare it for neural network training.
3) __Neural Network Implementation__: Building a neural network model using Keras and TensorFlow.
4) __Model Training__: Training the neural network on the training dataset and validating its performance on the validation dataset.
5) __Model Evaluation__: Assessing the performance of the neural network using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and visualization techniques.
6) __Visualization__: Displaying sample digit images, training progress, and model performance metrics.
